## Requirements for level 2 submission
Submissions for Level 2 must be in a digital format and include:

1. A comprehensive document in PDF format which outlines the model’s methodology, assumptions, data sources and limitations;
2. A slide deck which explains the model’s functionality, performance, business model and business impact;
3. A web link to the prototype of the Concept;
4. A video screen capture of the executable files in the .mp4 format;
5. The deadline for Level 2 Submissions will be by the end of 4 August 2024 Indian Standard Time and late Submissions will not be accepted.

    * Is the prototype of the Concept user-friendly and easy to navigate?
    * Are there clear instructions or guidance on how users should to interact with the prototype of the Concept?
2. Innovation:
    * Innovation of modelling techniques.
    * Does the prototype of the Concept showcase innovative approaches or techniques in fleet decarbonization optimization?
    * Are there unique features or functionalities that set the prototype of the Concept apart from existing solutions?
3. Scalability and Performance:
    * Can the prototype of the Concept be scaled to accommodate larger fleets or different scenarios?
    * Does the prototype of the Concept demonstrate scalability in terms of computational resources and data handling?
    * How efficiently does the prototype of the Concept execute the optimization algorithms?
    * Are there any performance bottlenecks or limitations encountered during testing?
